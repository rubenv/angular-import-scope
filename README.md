# angular-import-scope

> Import a scope from another ui-view.

Angular.JS structures your data in nested scopes. Which is great, except when page structure doesnâ€™t work like that and you need the inner data on a much higher level (say in the navigation). With import-scope, you can import the scope of a lower-level ui-view somewhere higher up.

**Note**: This depends upon the excellent [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router).

## Usage
Add angular-import-scope to your project:

```
bower install --save angular-import-scope
```

Add it to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="bower_components/angular-import-scope/dist/angular-import-scope.min.js"></script>
```

Reference it as a dependency for your app module:

```js
angular.module('myApp', ['rt.importscope']);
```

Link to a named ui-view somewhere to import the scope:

```html
<div id="header" import-scope="content@app">
    <h1>{{title || "No title"}}</h2>
</div>
```

**Note:** You need to specify the full name, which is of the form `viewname@statename`.
